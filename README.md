# MongoRedi
MongoRedi is a wrapper around the MongoDB driver that exposes the key CRUD operations that are needed to interact with an instance of MongDB.  Additionally, collections can be annotated to allow for all data to be retrieved from Redis rather than going all the way to MongoDB.

## Use Cases
MongoRedi is implemented using .NET Standard, so you can easily integrate it with the .NET Framework or .NET Core.

MongoDB is an excellent database for development and performance when accessing data for your application.  However, as you move toward the cloud, it can become expensive to run instances of MongoDB that require lots of memory.  Leveraging the power of Redis can take some of the burden off of MongoDB, which will lead to even better performance and cost savings.

## Setup
Install the NuGet package for your application.  If you have a multi-tiered architecture, then youâ€™ll want to make the installation in your data access layer.

https://www.nuget.org/packages/MongoRedi/

### .NET Core
Add the following properties in your appsettings.json file:

```
{
  "MongoRedi": {
    "MongoDBConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "MongoDBDatabase": "MongoRediTest",
    "RedisConnectionString": "localhost,connectTimeout=1000",
    "RedisDatabase": 0,
    "Cache": true
  }
}
```

The following settings are for a local development environment.  However, as you move toward the cloud you can easily swap your connection strings.

* MongoDBConnectionString - Connection string to MongoDB
* MongoDBDatabase - MongoDB database name
* RedisConnectionString - Connection string to Redis
* RedisDatabase - Redis database number (0 - 15)
* Cache - Globally turn cacheing of data in Redis on or off

Create a simple POCO that you would like to represent the documents for a collection:

```
[CollectionName("students")]
[Cache]
public class Student : BaseCollection
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

* CollectionName **(REQUIRED)**
  * This attribute sets the name of the collection as it will be stored in MongoDB
* CacheCollection (OPTIONAL)
  * This attribute determines if this collection will be stored in Redis
* CacheDocument (OPTIONAL)
  * This attribute determines if individual documents will be stored in Redis
* BaseCollection **(REQUIRED)**
  * This base class contains the \_id of each document, which is required for MondoDB

In the Sample.Core project you will see how you can inject each collection as a Singleton using the built-in dependency injection functionality:

```
// StartUp.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<IMongoDBRepository<Student>, MongoDBRepository<Student>>();
}
```

Or you can instantiate the class directly:

```
IMongoDBRepository<Student> _studentRepository = new MongoDBRepository<Student>();
```

### .NET Framework
Setup for the .NET Framework is the same except for the following:

Add the following properties to your web.config file:

```
<appSettings>
  <add key="MongoRedi_MongoDBConnectionString" value="mongodb://localhost:27017" />
  <add key="MongoRedi_MongoDBDatabase" value="MongoRediSample" />
  <add key="MongoRedi_RedisConnectionString" value="localhost,connectTimeout=1000" />
  <add key="MongoRedi_RedisDatabase" value="12" />
  <add key="MongoRedi_Cache" value="true" />
</appSettings>
  ```

As for dependency injection, you can use a 3rd Party container, or instantiate directly.

## Implementation
Once you have an instance you can the following APIs:

### GetAll
Returns all documents in a collection from MongoDB.

* If Redis is enabled, then all documents will be pulled from Redis, otherwise MongoDB will return all documents which will be stored into Redis, then returned

### Search
Accepts a LINQ expression to pull the desired documents from MongoDB

* If Redis is enabled, then documents are retreived from Redis and filtered, otherwise **GetAll** is called, then filtered by the expression

### Count
Efficently counts the documents in a collection using a LINQ expression without returning all values

* If Redis is enabled, the same logic as **Search** applies

### GetById
Returns a single document based on \_id of the document.  Accepts ObjectId or string as an input.

* If Redis is enabled, the document is retrieved from Redis, otherwise **GetAll** is called and the document is returned
* CacheDocument will store the individual document in Redis with the following key **[CollectionObjectName]__[ID]**

### Insert
A single document is added to the collection

* If Redis is enabled, after the insert the Redis data for the collection is removed

### InsertMany
Multiple documents are added to the collection

* If Redis is enabled, after the insert the Redis data for the collection is removed

### Update
Updates a single document

* If Redis is enabled, after the update the Redis data for the collection is removed 
* CacheDocument will remove the individual document stored in Redis

### Delete
Deletes a single document based on \_id of the document.  Accepts ObjectId or string as an input.

* If Redis is enabled, after the deletion the Redis data for the collection is removed 
* CacheDocument will remove the individual document stored in Redis

## Summary
I created this project after looking over the internet for best practices when working with MongoDB and Redis in the .NET technology stack.  I've used this code to integrate MongoDB Atlas with AWS Elasticache and it works great!  That being said, I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement.  If you have any suggestions or feature requests, please let me know.
